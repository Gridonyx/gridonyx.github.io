I've long had an interest to dabble in iOS app development, specifically personal finance and productivity app development. But I lacked a crucial component, a mac to develop on. Now that recently changed by the grace of one of my cousins, who decided to give me a 2020 MacBook Pro. 

Needless to say I was shocked, but incredibly appreciative. After getting the macbook all set up with Xcode and all my other usual programming tools like VSCode and git, I began searching around for content to learn Swift programming, and specifically SwiftUI. I came across Paul Hudson aka @TwoStraws aka Hacking With Swift on YouTube, and started watching his [Build your first iOS app with SwiftUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP-SQXTtWhY) video in which you follow along developing a simple application called Trekr to get a feel for some of the syntax and methodology behind iOS app development using SwiftUI. I learned about how assets are managed and referecned, some of the different views available like NavigationView, ListView, and TabView, not to mention structs and classes and even a bit of MapKit.

I think it was a fantastic way to start learning SwiftUI as it's more practical, at least for me, to learn more about programming by actually making working things. I've got his [Build your second iOS app with SwiftUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSwDfV6D_70&list=WL&index=3&t=281s&pp=gAQBiAQB) video sitting in my Watch Later now, just waiting for my next session of learning.
